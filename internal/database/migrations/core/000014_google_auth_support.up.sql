-- =====================================================
-- CORE SCHEMA - GOOGLE / EXTERNAL AUTH SUPPORT
-- =====================================================
-- Migration 014: Open up local-only assumptions in core.users so a user
-- can be created from an external identity provider (Firebase / Google
-- for now; Apple, Microsoft, etc. later) AND introduce a join table
-- that links one users row to one or many external identities.
--
-- Design notes:
--   - Local password stays on core.users.password_hash. password_hash is
--     made nullable because a Google-only user has no local password
--     until they explicitly set one via a future "set password" flow.
--   - username stays NOT NULL and unique. For Google sign-up, the
--     application layer derives a username from the email local-part
--     and resolves collisions with a numeric suffix (the schema does
--     not need to change for this).
--   - core.user_identities is the seam for multi-provider linking.
--     Lookup path on sign-in:
--        1. find by (provider, provider_user_id) → existing identity
--        2. else find users by email           → link to existing user
--        3. else create user + identity        → first-time sign-up
--   - One (provider, provider_user_id) pair maps to exactly one user
--     (enforced by UNIQUE). A single user may have multiple identities
--     (e.g. password + google linked to the same account).
-- =====================================================
